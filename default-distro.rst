.. note:: This page is a work-in-progress stub.

The wiki has `directions
<http://kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page#Firmware>`_ on how to
download, verify, and flash a copy of the original microSD image to recover
from any mistakes or bugs that would result in a "bricked" or unbootable
system.

See the "`Novena Image script`_" wiki page for details on building a debian
image from scratch.
